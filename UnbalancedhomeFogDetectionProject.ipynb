        "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom that affects individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, which significantly impacting their ability to walk and limiting their mobility and independence. Machine learning (ML) techniques can provide valuable insights into the occurrence and causes of FOG episodes. By leveraging ML, medical professionals can enhance their evaluation, monitoring, and prevention of FOG events. This notebook is based on Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Prediction competition dataset which includes data collected from a wearable 3D lower back sensor. The goal of this project is detecting the start and stop of each freezing episode, as well as identifying three types of FOG events: Start Hesitation, Turn, and Walking."

        "The objective is to develop a model to detect and predict Parkinson's FOG episodes. These episodes will be predicted based on time series data that was recorded for each patient during the execution of a specific protocol in addition to some provided patient characteristics. Given the availability of labeled targets in the dataset, a supervised learning approach is suitable for addressing this problem. Since there are multiple targets (Start Hesitation, Turn, and Walking), the problem is a one-class classification. The evaluation metric in this project is the mean average precision, which measures the average precision of predictions for each event class. Thus, accurate predictions of correct event types are more important than predicting all events correctly. Considering these requirements, this notebook presents a LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Model) model developed specifically to optimize the desired evaluation metric."

DeFOG dataset: This dataset comprises data series collected in the subject's home, where the subject also completed a FOG-provoking protocol. The identification of each series in the TDCSFOG dataset is provided in the \"tdcsfog_metadata.csv\" file. Each series is uniquely identified by the Subject, Visit, Test, and Medication condition. Similarly, the identification of each series in the DeFOG dataset is given in the \"defog_metadata.csv\" file, supplied by unique identifiers for Subject, Visit, and Medication condition."
